/*
question 1:  Which date had the least number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
 => redemption_date = 2023-11-02 , redemption_count = 0

question 2: Which date had the most number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
=> redemption_date = 2023-11-04 , redemption_count = 5224

question 3: What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?
=> createDateTime are null and 2023-11-05 11:00:00 UTC respectively

question 4: Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to).

=> Incremental Data Loading method is also one method we can use for this task.

I ordered what everybody told was the best,chicken kebab biryani. i am quite averse to the idea of having biryani with chicken without bones in it,but I decided to try something different. The rice I liked but the kebab pieces were too small and less in number. That ruins the fun especially when the ratio between them is not right. The Mirch ka Salan and Raita were very good. I don't think I would want to try the same biryani again,next time I'll have chicken with bones in it. But hey,try this out once at least eh? Who knows,"you might like it.\"\")]\"",[],Delivery,BTM,

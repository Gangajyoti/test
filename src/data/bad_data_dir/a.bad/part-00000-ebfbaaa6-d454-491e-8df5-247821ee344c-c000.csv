I always judge a place on how they do their basic dishes. A restaurant is only as good as their french fries. The fries were decent enough but the dip was damn yummy. Even though I am not a huge fan of salads,"my friend's ceasar salad was quite nice. i was blown over by my own chicken sliders. bloody brilliant. they are a teeny bit expensive but the experience is worth it. the restaurant also has pretty decent offers that make up for it. more visits are definitely in the pipeline.\"\")]\"",[],Dine-out,BTM,,,,,

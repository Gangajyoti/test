In both cases, the marinade and spices were absolutely fantastic both flavours were very authentic and the steamed bao was of great quality. The only grouse I had, was them skimping out on the meat quantity. The chicken was barely acceptable quantities whereas the prawn bao was more of a capsicum bao with just a few little shrimps thrown in.
